## About About Pages

The About page is a common convention found on websites.
It is your opportunity to let us know all the details "about" your project:

- I intend to make projects on analyzing data and providing insights in a variety of fields.
- I am still learning statistics and coding. 
- I have so many ideas on everyday contents I want to write, but not sure if it's wise to have so many topics. 

Will this table work? 

| Topics | Examples | How much I'm prepared |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Science Projects | Data analysis, Web crawling, Time-series data | Not really |
| Korean | The Korean alphabets, grammar, resources | Quite sure |
| Random Topics | cowboys, sharks, Titanic... | Many ideas, but have to research each time |
